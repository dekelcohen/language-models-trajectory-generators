## Timeline

### Subtask 1 (max_attempts=3)

> Pick up the small dark USB plug lying on the floor to the right of the laptop, in front of the laptop's right side. If the plug's body and its metal connector end can be told apart, grasp the plug body (the thicker housing), not the metal connector tip, so the connector stays exposed for insertion later. The laptop is to the left of the plug, with its screen upright and its base on the floor. Do not touch, push or collide with the laptop. After closing the gripper, lift the plug straight up about 20 cm above the floor and hold it there firmly in the gripper. A smaller lift is acceptable here b

- **Attempt 1: SUCCESS** (frames 1-88, 10/11 02:38)
  - Reviewer: The dark plug is visible between the fingers during the lift at wrist cam step 75, while the lower support remains on the floor. At the final state, the gripper remains closed on an object and has risen about 18 cm; the plug is partly obscured by the gripper. The laptop remains in place and upright (head cam step 88 and displacement measurement).
  - Evidence: Review: gripper evidence -> commanded CLOSED, but the fingers stalled at 1.6 cm (fully closed is ~0.1 cm): they are blocked by an object, so the gripper IS HOLDING something between its fingers right now. Use the clips to judge WHICH object it is and where it is - do not conclude that the gripper is

### Subtask 2 (max_attempts=3)

> The robot gripper is ALREADY HOLDING a small dark USB plug, lifted about 18 cm above the floor. Do NOT release it and do NOT try to grasp it again. Insert this plug into the laptop's USB port. Scene: a laptop sits on the floor to the left of and in front of the arm. Its screen stands upright and its base lies flat on the floor. The USB port was not clearly visible from the head camera. It is most likely a small rectangular slot on one of the thin side edges of the laptop base, and the right-side edge (the side nearest where the plug was picked up) is the most likely place. First, look for the
